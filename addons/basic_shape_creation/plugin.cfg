name="Basic Shape Creation"
description="An addon for the Godot Engine which adds a few basic functions for creating and modifying shapes,
and a few nodes that use those functions to create shapes and use them.

These functions and nodes are written in GDScript to make them universally compatible.
They are exposed to C# via wrapper classes in the `BasicShapeCreation` namespace.

--- Nodes ---

Currently, there are 2 nodes offered:
- BasicPolygon2D - General purpose node for creating, drawing, and exporting shapes
- BasicCollisionPolygon2D - A specialization of BasicPolygon2D that provides collision shapes to a parent, similar to CollisionPolygon2D.

--- Functions ---

Functions are provided under the BasicGeometry2D singleton. The provided functions include:

- add_shape - Creates a shape and inserts it into the provided array at the provided index.
- add_ring - Takes a shape and duplicates its points to be some proportional amount closer to the shape center.
- add_rounded_corners - Takes a shape and rounds the corners.
